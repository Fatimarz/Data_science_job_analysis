## Goal/Motivation
The goal of this project was to identify the most in-demand skills, tools, frameworks, and programming languages in the field of Data Science. To achieve this, I scraped job postings from TimesJobs and analyzed the data to uncover current market trends. This project helps aspiring data professionals align their learning paths with real-world industry demands.er

## Data Collection
The data was scraped from TimesJobs using Python. I collected key job-related information including:

- Job Type
- Experience Required
- Company Name
- Location
- Job Description
- Skills
- Salary

This data formed the foundation for analyzing the most frequently mentioned skills, tools, and technologies in Data Science job listings.
Code use for scrapping can be found [here](https://github.com/Fatimarz/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Data_science_job_analysis/DS_jobs_scrapping.ipynb)

## Tech Stack
- Python: Core programming language used throughout the project

- Requests & BeautifulSoup: For scraping job listings from TimesJobs

- Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning and analysis

- Jupyter Notebook: For writing and running the analysis 

- Streamlit: To build and deploy an interactive dashboard
## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Several preprocessing steps were applied to make the data analysis-ready:

- Category Mapping: Merged similar job titles into unified categories:

  "Data Science", "Data Science Analytics Manager", etc. ‚Üí Data Science

  "Machine Learning Engineer", "Machine Learning Specialist" ‚Üí Machine Learning

  "Data Science Internship", "Data Science Internship in Pune" ‚Üí Data Science Internship

- Text Cleaning:

  Converted text to lowercase

  Removed extra spaces and unwanted characters

- Experience Grouping:

  Transformed experience ranges into three levels: Junior, Mid-level, Senior


-  Missing Values Handling:

   Cleaned and imputed missing data where needed, including removing symbols $ etc
